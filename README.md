# The Effect of Rising Social Media Addiction on Shopping Behaviour

## Project Overview
This project will focus on the correlation between the widespreading usage of social media and increasing consuming desires categorized by the age groups. Main aim is to find if social media influences people to buy and consume more. By analyzing datas on how much time people spend online and how often do they buy things, it is expected to find a correlation between these parameters within this project outcomes. 

The analysis will rely on statistical methods and visualization techniques to examine correlation strength, variation across age groups, and potential nonlinear patterns. The project will finally decide whether social media acts as a meaningful predictor of consumption habits or whether the relationship is weaker or more complex than commonly assumed.

## Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis: There is no correlation between the screen time and consuming behaviours of people.

Alternative Hypothesis: Increasing screen time has a positive correlation with consumerism meaning that there is a significant correlation between each parameter.

## Motivation
Social media has evolved into one of the most influential environments in modern life. It creates trend and turns them into cycles of consumption. The constant exposure to these trends evolves into a strong link between online engagement and consumer behavior. My main motivation is to understand if constant exposure to social media alters consumption habits and which demographic groups are affected by this exposure the most.

## Data Sources and Collection
For this project I am going to make use of the datasets I found on Kaggle. I am going to use Python libraries such as numpy and pandas to take the useful parts of the found data. Next, I am going to use matplotlib to get a better visual representation of the foundings from the project. I am going to include datasets on recordeed screen times, demographical groups and consumer behaviour on purchasing. Also, I will add supportive datasets to strengthen my claim. This data integration will result in constructing a coherent analytical framework. Cleaning, standardization, and normalization steps will ensure comparability across heterogeneous sources.
